Finding and managing them is difficult (e.g., tracking status, understanding whether they are still actual, obsolete, or superseded).  \n\nInstead, we want a solution which will let us:  \n- Keep track of the decisions with the long-term consequences in a dedicated place.  \n- Capture reasoning and context behind every decision - to be able to get back to it and re-asses in the future. \n- See which decisions are actual, and which ones became obsolete or superceded.  \n- Have an easy way to document our experience related to a particular decision at any point in time.  \n- Use decision log as and additional documentation for the newcomers.  \n- Refer to the decisions easily (e.g. from the documentation or Jira tickets).  \n\n## Considered Options\n- Slack: [OnlyThreads](https://art-tu19272.slack.com/apps/A022BL4HJLD-onlythreads?tab=more_info) plus voting via emojis  \n- Slack: [loqbooq](https://art-tu19272.slack.com/apps/A0251FVDR0C-loqbooq?tab=more_info)  \n- Slack: [Decision Tracker](https://art-tu19272.slack.com/apps/A010B2YL469-decision-tracker?tab=more_info)  \n- GitHub Wiki  \n- Markdown files in repositories.  \n- [ADR manager](https://github.com/adr/adr-manager)  \n- [Log4Brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains?tab=readme-ov-file#log4brains-)  \n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: ?\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### All Slack tools\n\n**Pros:**  \n- No need to switch to another tool and the entire discussion can be easily captured.\n- Slack provides a number of tools helpful for the decision review process (voting, reminders, etc).\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Decisions are harder to manage and harder to link to from the external tools.  \n- The decisions are kept separately from other project documentation and code.  \n- Scaling to multiple projects will require additional effort (e.g. mapping decisions to projects).\n\n### GitHub Wiki\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Decisions are kept closer to the other documentation and codebase.\n- Decisions are scoped per project / repository.\n- Easy to link from the external tools.\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Lack of support for the workflows specific to decisions. E.g. status change, obsolete / superceded, etc.\n- Scaling to multiple projects will require additional effort.\n\n### Markdown files in repositories\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Decisions are kept and versioned along with other project documentation.\n- Decisions are scoped per project / repository.\n- Easy to link from the external tools.\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Lack of support for the workflows specific to decisions. E.g. status change, obsolete / superceded, etc.\n- Scaling to multiple projects will require additional effort.\n\n### [ADR manager](https://github.com/adr/adr-manager)\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Includes all benefits of keeping decisions in the markdown files in the repository.\n- Provides certain support for the workflows specific to decisions. (creation, search, editing).\n\n**Cons:**  \n- The workflow requires GitHub user with access to the repository.  \n- Scaling to multiple projects will require additional effort.  \n\n### [Log4Brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains?tab=readme-ov-file#log4brains-)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Includes all benefits of keeping decisions in the markdown files in the repository.\n- Best support for the workflows specific to decisions (among the reviewed tools).\n- Provides a way to support multiple projects, with minimal additional effort.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- Temporarily inactive maintainer.
