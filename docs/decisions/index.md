# Decision log
[![Rococo Decisions](https://ecorrouge.github.io/rococo/badge.svg)](https://ecorrouge.github.io/rococo)  
Welcome üëã to the decision log of the Rococo platform.

## Definition and purpose

An **Architectural Decision (AD)** is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.  

An **Architectural Decision Record (ADR)** captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitutes its decision log.

**Maintaining the decision logs allows us to:**  

- Keep track of the decisions with the long-term consequences in a dedicated place.  
- Capture reasoning and context behind every decision.  
- See which decisions are actual, and which ones became obsolete or superceded.  
- Document our experience related to a particular decision at any point in time.  
- Use decision log as and additional documentation for the newcomers.  
- Refer to the decisions easily (e.g. from the documentation or Jira tickets).
